# PushToTelescope
Please note that this is a pre release rebuild of a working version ( not on github) using coffeescript. This was written before ES6 and I wrote it to learn about changes in javascript. 

This webapp uses a smartphone to direct the movement of a telescope to a selected celestial object (as star, cluster, galaxy etc). 

It started out as an inclinometer to point my Dobsonian mounted 6 inch reflector.
